             Technology stimulates my imagination. Technology is also fun, because you learn more, and can experience more on computers, because computer is Technology. You can apply for jobs, and schools using technology.

            Technology has the ability to impact lives at a level and scale that has never been realized in the history of mankind. The idea that something I create can impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my passion for Technology.

        And, with skill and hard work - anyone can do it

        <h1>Importance of CSS</h1>
        <p>
            <b>What is CSS?</b>
            <em>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the coding language that gives a website its look and layout. Along with HTML, CSS is fundamental to web design. Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds. 
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.

            <b>Padding</b> - The inner space between the content and the border of your box. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Border</b> - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured above.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Margin</b> - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box
